## 🏠 Self-hosting

The recommended way to self-host is using Docker. You can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to get started quickly.

```yaml
services:
  whiteboard:
    image: ghcr.io/kellojo/whiteboard:latest
    container_name: whiteboard
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
      - BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
      - AUTH_ENABLE_EMAIL_PASSWORD=true
    volumes:
      - ./whiteboards:/app/.whiteboards
```

You can generate a secret with:

```sh
npx auth secret
```

> In production, always set a strong `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and use HTTPS for `BETTER_AUTH_URL`.

On first startup, auth tables are created automatically in `.whiteboards/auth.sqlite`.

### Optional OIDC providers

Configure one or more OIDC providers via `OIDC_PROVIDERS_JSON`.

```env
OIDC_PROVIDERS_JSON=[{"providerId":"keycloak","name":"Keycloak","discoveryUrl":"https://id.example.com/realms/main/.well-known/openid-configuration","clientId":"whiteboard","clientSecret":"replace-me","scopes":["openid","profile","email"]}]
```

After setting this, users can sign in with those providers on the `/auth/login` and `/auth/signup` pages.

### Optional email/password toggle

Set `AUTH_ENABLE_EMAIL_PASSWORD=false` to disable email/password login and signup forms.
OIDC provider sign-in remains available when configured.
